      # This will install a coldbackup script, i.e it will shut down nextcloud
      # before taking the backup. The reason for this is that the nextcloud
      # manual recommends putting nextcloud into "maintenance" mode before
      # backup up. Since maintenance mode prohibits anyone from actually using
      # nextcloud, we might as well bring it down.
