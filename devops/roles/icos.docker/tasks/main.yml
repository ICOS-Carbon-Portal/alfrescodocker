# Upgrading docker will restart containerd. Restarting containerd, even with
# live-restore enabled, will mess up networking for some applications - notably
# jupyterhub.
#
# Hence we mark docker.io and containerd as "hold" which will stop
# unattended-upgrades from upgrading them. However, one can upgrade them on
# demand using this role by setting docker_upgrade=True. In that case we must
# first mark them as "install".
