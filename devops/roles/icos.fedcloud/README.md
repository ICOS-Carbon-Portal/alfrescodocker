# EGI Federated Cloud

Add specialized support for interacting with the [EGI federated cloud](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/Main_Page). We build upon a pre-made egi docker image which gives us acces to the occi command. Combined with a the proper certificate we can then create virtual machines in the EGI cloud.
