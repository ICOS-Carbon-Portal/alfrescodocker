# CONTAINER IP CONFIGURATION.
# When the container is created, we let lxd assign a dynamic IP to the
# container (using dhcp on lxdbr0).
#
# We then take that IP and make it static (this is done by the "Set static lxd
# IP" task). This  way this works is by addding a special device to the
# container configuration.
#
# However, since we provide a list of all devices to be used by the container
# (the "__lxd_vm_devices" variable), we will overwrite the "static IP device"
# on subsequent runs if we're not careful.
#
# To work around this, we first extract any static IP devices and then add them
# to the list of devices to be used when configuring the container.
#
# Note that the "lxd_static_ip_info" module is written to return an empty list
# of devices for non-existing containers.
