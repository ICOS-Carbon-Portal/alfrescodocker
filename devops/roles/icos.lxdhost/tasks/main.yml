# To be able to access the container via ssh, ssh keys have to be added.
# The choices as to which keys to add are:
#   1. generate keys - either locally, on the remote machine or in the conatiner
#   2. pre-generate keys and keep as part of this role
#   3. add some other, pre-existing keys
#
# This tasks uses choice 3 and takes the authorized_keys file from a user on
# the remote machine and merges into the container. The user is typically the
# same used by ansible to deploy the container.
