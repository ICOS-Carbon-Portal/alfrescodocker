# nats comes by default with an "account" called $SYS, which is meant for
# "server operations and monitoring". The catch is that this "account" has no
# "user". We'll generate a password that can for creating the user (by
# configuring it in nats-server.yml).

# A nats context is simply a saved configuration. We save a configuration
# called "sys" which contains the username/password that allows us to connect
# to our local nats server with system privileges. We also make this context
# the default (by using --select). This way we can simply run "nats server
# ..."  as root and have full access.
