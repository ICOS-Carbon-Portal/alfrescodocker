# NetworkManager can use either:
#   1. systemd-networkd
#   2. its own dnsmasq
#   3. the system's resolvconf/dnsmasq
#
# We use option 3.

# We could install dnsmasq, then disable the main dnsmasq instance and letting
# NetworkManager run its own. Instead we just install dnsmasq and openresolv
# and NetworkManager will interact with them.
