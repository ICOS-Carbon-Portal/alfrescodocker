# Configuring client DNS resolution is much harder than setting up the DNS
# server.

# Depending on distribution is either openresolv + dnsmasq or systemd-networkd
# or NetworkManager (+ systemd). And maybe systemd-resolved.

# NetworkManager / systemd-networkd / systemd-resolved will all chat with each
# other over DBUS and sometimes they'll agree.

# To play on the hardest difficulty, add something like Mullvad VPN into the
# mix.
