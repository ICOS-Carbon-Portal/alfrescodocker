# Set the remote IP of the ssh connection, something that's surprisingly hard to
# get from ansible. Even though ansible can give you a list of all the
# interfaces on the machine, it cannot tell you which one of them you connected
# through.
#
# Even more confusing, ansible might not even know! If it's configured with only
# hostnames, it'll just pass the hostnames along to ssh which in turns can find
# the hostnames (either through DNS or through it's ~/.ssh/config file).
#
# When ssh logs in, it sets the SSH_CONNECTION environment variable to contain:
#   LOCAL_IP LOCAL_PORT REMOTE_IP REMOTE_PORT
#
# What this play does is save the REMOTE_IP part of that environment
# variable. This is useful for example when constructing ~/.ssh/config files on
# remote machines that needs to connect to other remote machines - all of which
# are reachable from the ansible controller.
#
# This might fail if ansible has executed any 'become' statement, which causes
# ansible to use sudo(1) which in turns provide a clean environment for ansible,
# thus loosing the SSH_CONNECTION variable.
